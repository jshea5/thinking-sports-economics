    <h1>Is Home Field Advantage Real in the NFL?</h1>

    <div class="bodytext">
        I’ve always wondered what it would feel like to be an athlete in hostile territory. For everywhere you look to see thousands of people, giddily and deafeningly praying for your missteps. To be on the other side of a home field advantage.
        <br><br>It has been said, and often repeated, that fans can have a big impact on the game. Today, I set out to decide whether or not that is true. Sure, countless coaches and players have cited fan involvement as being a factor in their play, but I want to see whether the numbers back up these assertions. Our mind can begin to play tricks on reality, especially when placed in a supercharged environment like an NFL field on any given Sunday. 
        <br><br>As somebody stumbling through an obscure sports/economics/psychology blog, I’m going to assume you’re familiar with the concept of home field advantage. So, I’ll spare you the background and jump right into my methods. 
        <br><br>First, I decided to examine this notion within the context of the NFL. Data on wins and losses is readily available on all major professional sports leagues, so look for later postings on the MLB and NBA. I utilized Football Reference for my data, extracting every game result from the last 5 seasons into an excel spreadsheet. From there, it was a few simple =IF and =COUNTIF functions used to create dummy variables which denoted whether the home or away team won. The final step was tallying up the home team wins, side by side with away team wins, and deducing each sides share of victories. 
        <br><br>Over the past 5 years, the visiting team has won 605 games, while the home team has won 706 games. If we lived in a world where home field advantage didn’t exist, we would expect those numbers to be much closer together. A difference of 101 victories over just a 5-year span is significant. Holding all else even, a team sees a 3.8% boost to their odds of winning, simply from playing at home. 
        <br><br>Some statisticians have suggested an even greater boost for home teams in the NFL. The positive association I observe between hosting a game and victories means my findings are consistent with much of the previous literature. As I’ve mentioned before I will be continuing this into a series to see if similar home field advantages are present in other major sports leagues.
