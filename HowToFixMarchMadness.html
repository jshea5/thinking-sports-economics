    <h1>How to Fix March Madness</h1>
    
    <div class="bodytext">
        Have you heard about that tournament in March that earns NCAA basketball 88% of its revenue in 18 days? The one that puts the rest of the sports world on pause and perfectly caters towards casual fans and diehards alike? The tournament which has been called the most exciting sporting event in the world? 
        <br><br>Well, for the integrity of the game, and for the sake of the participating players, I would like to change almost everything about it. 
        <br><br>Ok, not actually. March Madness is my favorite thing to watch on TV, bar none. The constant swings between heartbreak and absolute elation, with the knowledge that these players have worked their entire lives for this specific 40-minute game, keep me glued to my TV. I can’t get enough of it… yet I also know there’s something deeply wrong with it. 
        <br><br>You’ll find what I’m talking about from whispers on Reddit forums, to exclamations by ESPN commentators. At times it’s plastered right in front of us, blatant for even the most casual of fans to take note of. If I had to bet, I’d say you know what I’m talking about, but you think you don’t. We don’t like the cognitive dissonance of recognizing this fact. But you’ve made it this far, so I think you’re owed it being spelled out for you in black and white. The best team doesn’t always win. More than that, the best team usually never wins. More than that, the best team almost never wins! 
        <br><br>The current procedure for crowning an NCAA basketball champion is inherently flawed and a disservice to its players and coaches. This claim is backed by figures and statistics which I will go more in-depth on later in this post, but from a logical viewpoint, doesn’t this assertion make simple sense? 
        <br><br>In order to win March Madness and be crowned the best team in the nation, you must win 6 basketball games, with 0 margin for error. A bad game, or half, or even an extremely lucky half by your opponent, can spell the end of the best team’s season. It’s not that there’s no room for poor play, a desirable trait in a tournament meant to deduce a champion, it’s that there’s no room for bad luck. And basketball is much more susceptible to the winds of chance when compared to its athletic counterparts. Beautiful shots can rim out, while gross shots can bounce three times on the iron and clunk in. Referees change the pace and style of the game to a greater magnitude than they can in other sports. The notion of the “hot hand” has been debunked, and in that finding we learn that basketball is subject to the whims of fortune. 
        <br><br>Bear with me for a second. I know I just made a lot of claims, without much backing them. I will get to the support for my claims, but first I want to lay out some ground rules. The purpose of this post is to determine how to run March Madness, so the best team wins more often than they do right now. However, I want this to be a somewhat realistic proposal, so I’m going to set some boundaries for myself. First, I can’t inflate the tournament by more than 50%. These are student-athletes, and I’m sure that there are some rules regarding how long the season can last. Along those lines is my second rule; pay attention to the sponsors. It’s naïve to think that TV deals and sponsors don’t have a say in how March Madness is run. I need to come up with a format that might have some level of sponsorship approval. My final self-imposed regulation is that I can’t allow home-court advantage. I think playing at home could prove to be too big an advantage, and it kind of gets away from the spirit of March Madness. 
        <br><br>Let’s dive in.
        <br><br>In order to create a tournament that crowns the best team as champion more often, I first need to know how often the best team wins march madness. And before that, I need to come up with a definition of “best team.” Luckily, 25 years ago the NCAA selection committee made this an easy task for me. Beginning in 2004, the committee began denoting the #1 overall seed in the bracket. I can already hear what you’re saying. “What if the committee gets the best team designation wrong.” That’s a valid concern, but the title of “best” is already a subjective measure, so I’m going to rely upon the 10 experts who live and breathe college hoops to denote the top ranking. 
        <br><br>Building off of this, in the 19 tournaments which have been played since 2004, only 3 times has the #1 overall seed finished at the top. This is a win-rate of 15.79%. Let’s contrast this with the only other single elimination tournament in major sports, the NFL postseason. Since 1975, the NFL has had a #1 seed win the Super Bowl 53.2% of the time. Even if you divide that by two (which you probably shouldn’t because we’re operating under the assumption that the better team usually wins any game, be it the Super Bowl or a regular season college baseball game) the “best” team win rate is significantly higher than that of March Madness. 
        <br><br>In the last paragraph I mentioned that the NFL runs a single elimination tournament, a rarity amongst athletics. Besides for the NFL and NCAAM, no professional or collegiate tournament subjects its participants to such stringent regulations. The covert reasoning for why March Madness fails the objective of crowning the best team champion lies in its single elimination nature. Other tournaments rely on best-of-seven series to determine their champion, but this is not the reality of March Madness. Additionally, we’ve established that basketball is more prone to luck, be it good or bad, when compared to other sports. This lethal combination of a single elimination tournament and high levels of random variability is poison for the crowning of the best team. I’m not setting out to change the rules of basketball to ensure less variability. My task is to format the tournament to reduce variabilities impact. Call it favoring macro over micro.
        <br><br>I would now like to interject some additional research. In our established timeframe of 2004-2023, only one eventual champion, 2014 UCONN, has been placed lower than a 4 seed. This means that 18/19 March Madness champions have been ranked in the top 16 of the country in the past two decades. I know how unpopular what I’m about to say is, and I would like to reiterate that this proposal isn’t something I would like to see carried out, but speaking from a cold-hearted rational standpoint, I propose that we limit the NCAA tournament to 16 teams. They are the overwhelming majority of champions, and as much as we like the Cinderella runs, they aren’t equitable. If the point of the tournament is to crown the best team, we should whittle down the field of who has a chance to prove their worth. 
        <br><br>Based on the two previous paragraphs, we now have a basis for what our proposed tournament will look like. A field of 16 teams, with some sort of series styling incorporated. In a world without boundaries the series would be 50 games long in order to reduce variability. However, that’s not the reality we take part in, so my proposal is a 3-game series. I came to this figure based on the rules I have previously mentioned. Since I’m only allowed to grow the tournament by a maximum of 50%, I can’t have more than 
        <br><br>It's clear that a series-styled tournament is a major step in reducing luck’s hand in crowning the champion. However, based on the guidelines I have self-imposed, I can’t have more than 101 games played. The NCAA tournament is currently 67 games long (not including the First Four), and 67*1.5=100.5. Assuming an average series length of 2.5 (which is generous because again, we expect the better team to win more than 50% of the time) we arrive at 37.5 games on average (15 series played * 2.5 expected games per series). This number seems shockingly low in comparison to the traditional March Madness’ figure of 67, until you get to my second major proposal. 
        <br><br>As I write this, the Women’s College World Series is currently on ESPN. They, like men’s baseball, utilize a double elimination bracket. This means if they lose one game, they go down to the consolation bracket, where they can claw their way back into championship contention. Whichever team “wins” the consolation bracket then faces the winner of the “winners” bracket with the “winners” champion needing to win 1 series, and the “losers” champion needing to win 2 series. This rewards teams for winning but doesn’t immediately disqualify teams for losing. The addition of a consolation bracket in March Madness is another step in reducing variability in the tournament. We’ve gone from a bad half being the downfall of teams in March Madness, to not even 3 bad games spelling your demise. I know it doesn't sound fun, but it is more equitable. 
        <br><br>My final proposed amendment to March Madness is once again, taken from another professional league. The NFL, which as has been discussed before possesses the only other single-elimination postseason tournament, utilizes reseeding after the first round of the playoffs. This is expressly done to favor and reward the higher seeds for better performances in the regular season. For March Madness, my proposal is to copy the NFL, but add one more round of reseeding, but only in the winner’s bracket. I believe that this will reduce variability in the tournament and is my final measure in attempting to consistently crown the best team each year. 
        <br><br>So, there we have it. I have massacred something universally loved by fans, sponsors, students, athletes, coaches, etc. For the final time, I would like to state that I don’t actually want to see these changes take place. I love March Madness like no other sporting event. However, if I’m looking at the tournament through a statistical, logical, and moral lens, I see that changes need to be made. In summation, I would cut the tournament to 16 teams, make each round a best-of-three series, add in a consolation bracket, and reseed teams after the first 2 rounds in the winner’s bracket. I know this all sounds abstract, so I’ve taken the top 16 teams from the most recent tournament, 2023, and played out a theoretical bracket attached below. Thanks for taking the time to read my butchering.
