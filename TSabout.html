    <p>My friends! My name is Jack Shea, and I am a recent graduate from Elon Univeristy. During my time at Elon, I studied Economics and Psychology,
       was a flanker on the Club Rugby team, and served as the VP of Brotherhood for my fraternity - Beta Theta Pi.
       <br> <br> I have a lot of interests. Reading, writing, and coding
       are pastimes and skills which I enjoy, yet I'm cognizant of the fact that I don't dedicate enough time to them. 
       I began this blog as a challenge to myself to complete a goal which wouldn't come quickly. I find that since I have a wide range
       of interests, when things become difficult in one area, I'm too quick to put it down and chase after something new. 
      <br> <br>I want to be better than that.

       This blog serves to combine my varying interests into a purposeful project. The point isn't to attract 100 dedicated readers, or for that matter,
       even 1 erratic reader. The point is to work on my passions and see a goal through to the end. Thank you for joining me on this journey,
       no matter how long you stay. 
    </p>
